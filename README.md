#Flask Boiler

##Overview
This is a simple boilerplate application for [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

I've modified the boilerplate more to my liking, but feel free to fork it and tune it in whatever way you like.

##Setting up the environment
* Install memcached
    ```sudo apt-get install memcached```

* Create a virtual sandbox and install packages for project by running

    ```sh
    chmod +x setup_env.sh

    ./setup_env.sh
    ```


##Running your app
* Once everything is setup, run your flask application:

    ```sh
    chmod +x run.py

    ./run.py
    ```
